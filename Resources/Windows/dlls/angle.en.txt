ANGLE guidelines for ONScripter-RU
Enables DirectX 9/DirectX 11 renderer.

You must have EP5 game or newer (i.e. onscripter-ru r2846 or higher).


Installation:
1. Edit your ons.cfg (or default.cfg if ons.cfg is missing) file and
add the following lines if needed.

2. Enable the renderer (REQUIRED):
prefer-renderer=ANGLE2 (or ANGLE3 for DirectX 11)

3. Force rendering style (USE ONLY WITH LEGACY ANGLE):
render-self=yes

4. Set preferred shader library (USE ONLY IF GAME CRASHES AT START):
d3dcompiler=d3dcompiler_43.dll


Notes:
You could use legacy libraries by copying the contents of dlls\legacy
folder into the corresponding folder:
dlls\6.1  for Windows 7 and higher
dlls\5.1  for Windows XP and higher

Legacy libraries should require render-self=yes but in normal cases
should also reduce memory consumption. However, you should probably
choose best performing variant. To do so you may use FPS reporting
in window title. Enabled with:
show-fps

For better error logging you may use:
use-console

You could specify custom d3dcompiler library if you have it installed.

You could copy newer versions of libGLESv2.dll and libEGL.dll from your
browser folder, for example, Opera and Mozilla Firefox use them.
You must ensure that they are 32-bit.
