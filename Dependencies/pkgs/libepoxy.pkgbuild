# TODO: Upgrade libepoxy in some future, but this will require patches:
# 1.5.x branch till 1.5.3 is pretty much broken:
# - https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy/issues/160
# - https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy/issues/180
# 1.5.0 and newer do not have configure, and autoreconf requires xorg macros.
# As they switched to meson, upgrading to 1.5.3 will require supporting meson
# in onscrlib rather than attempting to work around no longer supported autotools.
